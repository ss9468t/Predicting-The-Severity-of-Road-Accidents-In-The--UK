Predicting The Severity of Road Accidents In The UK. 
Developing a system to provide a more effective response in case of road accidents.
It is possible to predict the severity of an accident using some variables that can
potentially be gathered on the place of the accident.
Provide is a dataset of all the accidents that occurred in 2019 in the UK 
Using machine learning techniques to predict the accident severity in details
(that is, whether an accident is “fatal”, “serious” or “slight” – 3 classes in total), 
from all theother features in the dataset. For the avoidance of doubt, the information 
about accident severity is contained in the column titled “accident_severity”.
Comparing traditional machine learning algorithms with neural networks to see if
the latter offer significantly higher performance.
The results of the analysis and implementation are in the pdf report.
